                <p class="standard">My name is Aitizaz, this section will cover who I am. I
                     finished sixth form not too long ago and achieved 3 A-levels in Computer Science, Economics and
                    Business Studies. I am now doing a degree apprenticeship with a tech company called <strong><a
                    href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/">Fujitsu,</a></strong> as a software developer and attend
                    <strong><a href="https://www.mmu.ac.uk/">Manchester Metropolitan University</a></strong> on the Digital and Technology Solutions pathway.

                <div>
                    
                    <p>
                    The reason for choosing this career path was, ever since I was little, I had been curious
                    about how things work, and I would take them apart to learn what each component would do for
                    something like a computer or a phone. This sparked my interest in technology, and I am now a tech
                    geek obsessed with trying to get my hands on the latest tech! Which has proven to be very expensive as innovation is constant.

                    <p>
                    Here I am going to talk about technology and it&#8217;s advancements. Technology comes from two Greek
                    words &#8217;<strong><em>Techne</em></strong> &#8217; which means arts or craft and &#8217;<strong><em>logos</em></strong> &#8217; means
                    thought or
                    principle. Combining them forms &#8217;<b><a
                            href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~funkk/Technology/technology.html">Tekhnologia</a></b>&#8217;
                    this was changed to English in today&#8217;s language as &#8217;<em>technology</em> &#8217;.
                    </p>
                   
                </div>
                    <!--Used Div and p tag for this so that I could style the page breaks without <br> tags-->
                    <!--&#8217; is added to create a typographically correct apostrophe-->

                <div>
                   
                    <p>
                    The first form of technology was the wheel. This allowed for other things to be created
                    like tools from materials like iron or bronze which led to ships being made to increase efficiency
                    to the point in todays day and age where phones, internet and now A.I (artificial intelligence) is
                    created. This doesn&#8217;t stop there as there are many things that can be done with A.I that may allow new technology to be discovered.
                    Technology is everywhere and we are very dependent on it.

                    <p>

                    Technology is not limited to wires and motherboards etc, it can be in other forms; like stone 
                    tools being one of the earliest pieces of technology to help create something for the benefit of humanity.  Today it has come to a 
                    point where we make prosthetic limbs for amputees with the help of technology.

                    is a long and fascinating one, and it continues to shape the way we live and interact with the world

                            It was the primary Macintosh operating system until the late 1990s when it was replaced by MacOS 8. This shows 
                            how different and basic the operating system looked by then compared to now, where it is at a higher resolution 
                            and with greater features that users have access to than they could back in the 1990s, showing how technology back 
                            then was completely different from today&#8217;s technology and also taking into consideration that the internet was 
                            relatively new in the 1990s.</p>

                            components on the motherboard. Most of the components are so tiny, that you would need to use a microscope to see them,
                            and it is very amazing to see that technology has now come to a point where components can be reduced to up to 90% 
                            of their original size, and there are so many of them scattered around a motherboard, and each and every component 
                            plays a part in the functionality of a laptop.</p>

                            design layout to today's prosthetics, but they were limited in functionality, for a prosthetic limb user
